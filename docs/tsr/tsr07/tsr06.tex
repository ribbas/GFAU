    \section{Introduction} The Galois Field Arithmetic Unit will accept two inputs
    a and b and determine the desired arithmetic result n, and to establish the field generating polynomial. The unit would serve as a computation engine for a relatively low-powered
    microcontroller, and would enable complex code and encryption algorithms.
    Project will include implementation of a Reed Solomon encoder and decoder
    using the GFAU. The purpose of this report is to detail the progress of the
    GFAU in the period of December 7, 2017 through February 9, 2018. This is
    the sixth and first status report for the second semester for the GFAU
    team.

    \section{Completed Tasks} During this work period, the team has continued
    to make progress on the GFAU. Including the following achievements:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]

        \item Most VHDL coding is done with issues detail in the Current Issues section of this document. 
        \item Updated system block diagram (see Figure 1 below). 
        \item Completed breakout board design. 
        
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Planned Tasks}
   
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]

        \item Order breakout board.
        \item Program FPGA with VHDL code and resolve any issues arise. 
        \item Interface FPGA with external memory.

    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Current Issues} Current issues the team are having include: 
	
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
		\item Need to receive testing instruments from Dr. LaBerge to verify design. 
		\item Timing issue with zero and the zeroth term and their memory address.
		\item Timing issue with generating polynomials.		
		\item Problem generating one symbol per clock cycle.
		\item Not sure how to simulate memory and IO with VHDL.
	\end{enumerate}
