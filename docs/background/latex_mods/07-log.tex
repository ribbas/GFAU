\subsubsection{Logarithm} Logarithm is considered a unary operation in the
Galois Field, where only one operand is required. This is because implicitly,
the base of the logarithm operation in the Galois Field is 2. The logarithm of
a Galois operand is congruent to its index.

    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            log_{2}(\alpha^{i}) & = i \\
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
