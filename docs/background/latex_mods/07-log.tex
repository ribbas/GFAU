\subsubsection{Logarithm} Logarithm is considered a unary operation in the
Galois Field, where only one operand is required. The base of the logarithm
operation in the Galois Field is implicitly 2. The logarithm of a Galois
operand is congruent to its index.
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            log_{2}(\alpha^{i}) & = i \\
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}

    inputs are valid for this operation.
