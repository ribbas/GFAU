\subsubsection{Logarithm} Logarithm is considered a unary operation in the
Galois field, where only one operand is required. Logarithm here refers to the degree of the operand.
    \begin{equation*}
        log_{\alpha}(\alpha^{i}) = \deg(\alpha^{i}) = i \\
    \end{equation*}

    \paragraph{{\small Digital Design}} \leavevmode \\ Only element forms of
    inputs are valid for this operation.

    The logarithm of a Galois operand is the index of the term itself.
