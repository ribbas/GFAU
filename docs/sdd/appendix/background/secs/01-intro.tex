\section{Background} Galois fields (denoted $\gf{p^n}$, where $p,n \in
\mathbb{N}_{>0}$, and $p$ is prime) are fields with finite orders of $p^n$.
They are a key part of number theory, abstract algebra, arithmetic algebraic
geometry, and cryptography. In error detection and correction, Galois fields
are utilized in cyclic redundancy check (CRC) which are used in digital
networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data.

The Galois Field Arithmetic Unit (GFAU) is a scalable arithmetic logic unit
(ALU) capable of generating elements in the Galois field of an irreducible
polynomial in $\gf{2^n}$, where $2 \leq n < (\text{$\#$ of memory address
pins})$. GFAU supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and
logarithm of these elements for low powered devices.

    \subsection{Purpose and Scope} This document will demonstrate the
    functionality of the unit by deriving all its functionality through
    mathematical approaches. The mathematical algorithms will be accompanied by
    the modules that implement them in digital design. The modules will contain
    brief documentation on their usages.

    \subsection{Terms and Keywords}

        \subsubsection{Input Primitive Polynomials} Input primitive
        polynomials in the Galois Field are represented as:

        \[ c_{n}x^{n}+\ldots+c_{2}x^{2}+c_{1}x^{1}+c_{0}x^{0}, \text{ where }
        c,x \in \mathbb{Z}_2 \]

        For convenience and simplicity, all the examples provided will refer to
        the polynomial: \examplepoly~.

        \subsubsection{Elements} The elements of an input polynomial refer
        to the $2^{n}-1$ elements in the field.

        \subsubsection{Polynomial Form} The polynomial forms of the
        elements refer to the $2^{n}-1$ symbolic representations of the input
        primitive polynomials in the field.

        \subsubsection{Example} An example of the elements and their
        corresponding polynomials is provided below:

            {\scriptsize [1]} The additive identity, 0 (zero), referred to as
            NULL, in its element form is reserved where its binary symbol does
            not represent its decimal value. \\ {\scriptsize [2]} Elements
            beyond the $(2^{n}-1)$th element will be handled with special
            conditions since they cycle back to previous elements.
