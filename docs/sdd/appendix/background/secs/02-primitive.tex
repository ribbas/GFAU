\subsection{Primitive Polynomial} A polynomial is said to be irreducible if and
only if there exists no roots for it. A primitive polynomial is an irreducible
polynomial that generates all elements of an extension field from a base field.
\cite{primitive}

Determining irreducibility of a polynomial can be achieved by performing
exclusive disjunctions on all the bits of the polynomial vector.

\begin{align*}
    \text{irreducible} & =
    \begin{cases}
        true, & \text{if } < v_{n} \oplus \ldots \oplus v_{2} \oplus v_{1} \oplus v_{0} > = 1 \\
        false, & \text{if } < v_{n} \oplus \ldots \oplus v_{2} \oplus v_{1} \oplus v_{0} > = 0
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}

However, determining if a polynomial is primitive requires precomputing the
elements and checking those that are prime factors to $2^n-1$ in a brute forced
manner.

To determine if an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$ is primitive, $2^n-1$ must be the smallest element in its field to satisfy
    \begin{equation*}
        x^{2^n-1} \equiv 1 \Mod{p(x)}
    \end{equation*}

If the prime factors,
$\{p_0^{\alpha_0},p_1^{\alpha_1},\ldots,p_k^{\alpha_k}\}$, of $2^n-1$ are
known, it is sufficient to check that none of them would satisfy the condition
listed above.

    \subsubsection{Modules} Checking for primitive polynomials is beyond the
    scope of the project. Therefore, modules for checking irreducibility and
    primitivity are not implemented in the design.
