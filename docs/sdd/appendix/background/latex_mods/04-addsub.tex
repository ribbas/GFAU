\subsubsection{Addition and Subtraction} Binary addition and binary subtraction
are synonymous in the Galois Field. Addition and subtraction of Galois operands
may be done by bitwise exclusive OR-ing the operands.
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            \alpha^{i} \pm \alpha^{j} & = \{ x_{i, n}, \ldots x_{i, 2},
            x_{i, 1}, x_{i, 0} \} + \{ x_{j, n}, \ldots x_{j, 2}, x_{j, 1},
            x_{j, 0} \} \\
            & = \{(x_{i, n} \oplus x_{j,n}), \ldots (x_{i, 2} \oplus x_{j,
            2}), (x_{i, 1}\oplus x_{j, 1}), (x_{i, 0}\oplus x_{j, 0})\} \\
            & = \alpha^{k}
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}

    \paragraph{{\small Digital Design}} \leavevmode \\ Only polynomial forms of
    inputs are valid for these operations.

    The implementation of Galois addition and subtraction may be computed with
    a single-level parallel array of XOR gates.
