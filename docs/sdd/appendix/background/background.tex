    \section{Design} Input polynomials will be represented as $n$-bit
    binary-coded decimal (BCD) arrays.

    For example, the polynomial \examplepoly~ will be represented in a system
    with 16-bit data words as
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{split}
                <0000 \ 0000 \ 0000 \ 1101> & \text{  (3rd, 2nd, and 0th bits)}
            \end{split}
        \end{equation*}

        \subsection{Operations} GFAU supports addition, subtraction,
        multiplication, division and logarithm of elements in Galois fields.
        The \texttt{operators} module consists of the \texttt{addsub},
        \texttt{mul}, and \texttt{div} modules that are responsible for their
        corresponding binary operations. Additional helper module,
        \texttt{maskedtwoscmp}, is included to compute the two's complement of
        the second operand required for division. The other two modules,
        \texttt{outselect} and \texttt{outconvert} act as advanced multiplexers
        to determine the output of the operation requested.
