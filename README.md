## Galois Field Arithmetic Unit

This project will produce a hardware-based unit for performing arithmetic operations in Galois Field 2^n, where n = 2â€¦10. Unit will accept inputs to determine n, and to establish the field generating polynomial. A GFAU would serve as a computation engine for a relatively low-powered microcontroller, and would enable complex code and encryption algorithms. Project will include implementation of a Reed Solomon encoder and decoder using the GFAU.
