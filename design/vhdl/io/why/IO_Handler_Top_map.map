  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of   2,860    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          274
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           201 out of     274   73%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  17 out of     274    6%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             126 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
