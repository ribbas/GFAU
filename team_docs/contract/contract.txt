Absences
Absence from team meetings may be necessary due to personal and unforeseeable circumstances. In the event

punctuality and responsibility will result in the member being deemed an obstruction to progress.

updates on progress or collaborative work.

Division of Labor
Team Decisions
Lack of participation from a member will result in exclusion of their inputs regarding team decisions.
Vote
Unanimous voting on team decisions are preferred. In the event where unanimous voting is improbable, team
decisions will be made based on the majority vote. In the event where none of the previous voting ratios are
improbable, team decisions will be made after consultation with the engineering manager or Dr. LaBerge.
